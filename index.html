    <p>The home page has a lot of elements I am not familiar with, including the main and script. I think the main tag encompasses the whole site because the whole browser window is highlighted when I hover over it.
    <br>
    What I love about this site, is how user friendly and organized it looks. The splash page, marks each location of this climbing gym, and when you enter into each location's individual site, all of the site's categories are displayed on the front, with a complementary image.

  <h1>Be a part of the community</h1>
    <p>
      There is a great community and support system in rock climbing. Even if you do not consider yourself athletic, it is easy to pick up. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're lazy, you have a great motivation to hang out with friends. Climbers are very social, so you can meet new people, work together to solve the same problem, and then grab a beer after! This is very common.
